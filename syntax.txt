# Language Syntax and Rules

## Variables
- Variables are declared and assigned using the '=' operator.
- The 'let' keyword is not required.
- Variable names should not contain spaces.
- Example:
  x = 10
  message = "Hello, World!"

## Data Types
- The language currently supports Numbers and Strings.
- Types are inferred from the assigned value.
- String literals must be enclosed in double quotes.

## Output
- The 'prt' command is used to print values to the console.
- It can print string literals or the value of a variable.
- Example:
  prt "This is a message."
  my_variable = "some value"
  prt my_variable

## Input
- The 'input' command is used to get input from the user and store it in a variable.
- The value is always stored as a string.
- Example:
  prt "What is your name?"
  input user_name
  prt "Hello, "
  prt user_name

## Conditional Logic
- 'if', 'else if', and 'else' statements are supported for conditional execution.
- Conditions must be enclosed in parentheses ().
- Code blocks for each condition must be enclosed in curly braces {}.
- Supported comparison operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
- Example:
  x = 10
  if (x > 5) {
    prt "x is greater than 5"
  } else if (x == 5) {
    prt "x is 5"
  } else {
    prt "x is less than 5"
  }
